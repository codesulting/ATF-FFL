# Party Totals 2014-2016

![](R_plots/06-model-building-legislature/EDA-facet-bar-party-by-year.png)

A common thread through the party totals over the years is 
- a receding of **Democratic** seats, and
- slight increase in **Divided**, **Independent**, and **Split** seats.
- **Republican** seats remain relatively steady, with a slight increase from 2014-15.

There might be a popular notion that Republicans are 'gaining' seats on Democrats, but the voting results show Democrats are losing seats to Independents, and within-state divisions are increasing - particularly arriving at 2016.
