# What is a Federal Firearms License?

In the United States, a Federal Firearms License (FFL) is a requirement for those who engage in the business of firearms - generally **dealers**, **manufacturers**, and **importers**. 

It's not actually a license to carry a firearm; it's strictly for the conducting business involving firearms. It's not necessary to have one if selling at gun shows, or when purchasing guns for personal reasons. 

The ATF considers 9 __types__ of FFLs: 

- Dealer
- Pawnbroker
- Collector
- Manufacturer of Ammunition
- Manufacturer of Firearms
- Dealer in Destructive Devices
- Manufacturer of Destructive Devices
- Importer of Destructive Devices

'Destructive Devices' constitute their own class, and are [defined by the National Firearms Act](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/firearms-guides-importation-verification-firearms-national-firearms-act-definitions-1), [26 U.S.C. ยง 5845(F) (page 82)](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/guide/atf-guidebook-importation-verification-firearms-ammunition-and-implements-war/download). Three examples, as shown in an illustration from the ATF Guidebook:

The ATF bullet points defining Destructive Device are: 

- A missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than 1/4 oz. (**1/4 oz explosive/incendiary**)
- Any type of weapon by whatever name known which will, or which may readily be converted to expel a projectile, by the action of an explosive or other propellant, the barrel or barrels of which have a bore greater than one-half inch in diameter. (**1/2" bore**)
- A combination of parts designed and intended for use in converting a device into a destructive device and from which a destructive device can be readily assembled.

The ATF [publishes data on this FFL holders](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees-ffls-2016) monthly, from 2013 to present. Additionally, an [annual commerce report](https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/data-statistics) is released, which contains numbers on weapons registrations, imports and taxes, and historical FFL data. With historical FFL data, we can broadly see how license counts have changed over time - from 1975-2015. 

By the 9 Types of FFLs as defined by the ATF, how have the counts changed from 1975 to 2015<sup>[1](#works-cited)</sup>?

![FFL-History-02](indd/assets/TypesOverTime-V2.jpg)

- Looking specifically at Destructive Devices - the number has increased steadily and heavily since 1975.
- Manufacturers of Ammunition have gone down dramatically
- around 2010, Manufacturers of Firearms began to increase steadily.
- peak of all FFL types appears to have happened in the early 1990s.
