## Data - Federal Firearms Licenses

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives ([ATF](https://www.atf.gov/)) maintains [listings of Federal Firearms licensees](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees-ffls-2016) online, dating back to 2013. This detailed data comes in the form of .xlsx or .txt files.


Other notes:

- 2016: .pdf for 'FFL Type by State' for April is actually for Explosives, not Firearms
- 2015: no data for September, October (no explanation)
- 2014: January through May, and September are missing Expiration variable
- 2013: no data for October (government shutdown)

Glimpse of the data:
